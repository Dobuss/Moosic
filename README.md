# Moosic

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.2.9. for the SoftUni Angular Exam in December 2022.

# Purpose

Mood + Music = Moosic.

Have you ever wanted to listen to music, but didn't know which song to play? Have you ever had thoughts like 'I am in a happy mood today, I need a song to match it'?
The purpose of this app is to help you find music based on your mood, so you don't waste time browsing though thousands of songs until you find the right one.
